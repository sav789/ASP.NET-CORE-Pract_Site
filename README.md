# ASP.NET-CORE-Pract_Site

This is my very simple practice ASP.NET_Core(2.x) MVC website that is ran on the local host. It utilizes a few minor Razor page and MVC concepts. Further updates will be added as well for a better more complete user experience. This is a website I am making and updating just for fun and learning purposes. I most likely will re work the website completely in the future.

NAVIGATION OF SITE: The only buttons/links that are not implemented: - all of the drop-down options under Resources - all of the drop-down options under Explorers EXCEPT the read our blog - the "read our blog" part is render in Razor syntax
